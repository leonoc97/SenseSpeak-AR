# SenseSpeak-AR
SenseSpeak AR is a project from the MCI Master's in Medical Technologies (3rd semester, Winter Term 2024/2025). It helps users learn the sign language alphabet (ABC) and basic communication through a sensoric hand with AR support, combining tactile feedback and visual guidance to assist institutions supporting the deaf community.
